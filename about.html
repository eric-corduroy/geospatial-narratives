          <p>Geospatial Narratives is a project and tool that has grown over the years from a mix of personal frustration, curiosity, observation, curatorial practice, and an evolving critical awareness - now finally taking shape in this form.</p>
          <p>As an information designer who first encountered satellite data more than ten years ago, I ran into the obstacles I believe many non-experts face when approaching this medium: technical complexity, a lack of accessible context, and little guidance on how to interpret what I was seeing. While much has changed since then - particularly in terms of access, data availability, and analytical tools - I’ve continued to miss a comprehensive overview of how satellite imagery is used narratively, along with critical, media-theoretical reflection on its role in public discourse.</p>
          <p>What began as a purely illustrative and aesthetic use of satellite data as visual material in design projects gradually developed into the subject of a more research-oriented practice of a medium and its technological, political and phenomenological dimensions.</p>
          <p>My interest and rudimentary, self-taught understanding of working with this data eventually led, by serendipity, to my role on the DataViz team at <a href="https://www.planet.com/">Planet Labs</a>, a large provider of commercially available high-resolution satellite data. Working closely with a team of great experts, the selection, translation and visualization of data for international reporting on global events (conflicts, environmental disasters) became a daily challenge and routine. This gave me a deep insight into the intersection of technology, science and media representation and made me increasingly aware of the shortcomings (ignorance, misperception) that users (including myself) have or might face when dealing with this medium.</p>
          <p>Today, in an age shaped by the potnetial of deepfakes, disinformation campaigns, and the strategic misframing of events by political actors, the ability to critically assess data (sources) and visual evidence is no longer a luxury - it is a public necessity.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-column">
          <p>What was once a rare reporting tool, mostly accessible only through external, often governmental or intelligence sources, has become an omnipresent visual element. Technological advances as well as the general privatization and commercialization of a field that was previously mainly scientific and military have made these data more accessible than ever before. Besides their value as reporting tools in inaccessible regions and situations, the images are increasingly used decoratively, as crude accessories to events whose vertical perspective offers no real journalistic added value (for example, in coverage of the Baltimore bridge collapse or the Ever Given incident).²</p>
          <p>Yet it is precisely this seemingly familiar view, which in a way suggests objectivity and omniscience, that makes this medium so appealing - not least because Google Earth and Maps have conditioned us to it over many years. However, their readability is anything but intuitive, and the underlying data and technologies are anything but self-explanatory—and certainly not, as often assumed, objective or neutral.</p>
          <p>What appears to be finished results of familiar photographic processes or media is in reality the outcome of complex scientific measurements influenced by environmental factors, which are only made visible and interpretable through digital processes - automated and/or involving human intervention. As a hybrid of data visualization, photography, and cartographic representation, satellite images reveal aspects of our environment that are otherwise inaccessible - whether in terms of spatial scale or spectral information beyond human vision. At the same time, the technology that produces these images remains largely hidden and abstract to most viewers, frequently misrepresented or oversimplified by popular narratives that obscure the complex geopolitical and physical realities behind this infrastructure.</p>      
          <p>Already in 2013, Laura Kurgan pointed out that satellite images are “stripped of their data and presented to us as images already interpreted by experts.” In the same work, she argued that “for every image, we should be able to ask about its technology, its location data, its ownership, its readability, and its source.” Media theorist and philosopher Lisa Parks similarly emphasized “the need for greater public knowledge about satellite technologies and increased literacy around the images they generate.”</p>        
          <p>What might not have been considered essential media literacy twenty years ago is now indispensable - and yet it is still scarcely present. Discussions about this, unlike the images themselves, have so far hardly reached the mainstream.</p>
          <p>Geospatial Narratives addresses this very issue and aims to make both well-founded knowledge and critical engagement around the medium of satellite imagery accessible to a broader public.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="methodologyContent" class="info-columns-container about-content-section">
      <div class="info-column">
          <p>The information presented on this platform combines explicit details from published articles with interpretations based on experience with satellite imagery as both a visual and technical medium.</p>
          <p>Some facts are straightforward: publication date, source, headline, and the geographical region referenced are taken directly from the articles. However, the accompanying satellite images often lack crucial context. Who captured the image? Which sensor was used? What exactly is visible in the image?</p>
          <p>To help fill these gaps, I rely on publicly available information about the technical capabilities of satellites, visual indicators within the imagery itself, and an interpretive sensibility developed through regular work with geospatial data. When the satellite or sensor is named, it is often possible to infer the <mark>sensor type</mark> - such as optical, radar, or hyperspectral - based on known characteristics. The <mark>visualization</mark> of satellite data - whether as true color or false color composites, or as derived indices like NDVI - is shaped by sensor properties, processing choices, and the thematic focus of the article, such as flooding, wildfires, or deforestation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-column">
          <p><mark>Resolution</mark>, however, is difficult to pin down. It is often not specified and can be visually misleading due to cropping, rescaling, or digital post-processing of the image making it ultimately impossible to determine with precision. In such cases, I refer to the known native resolution of the most likely satellite bands used and assign the image to one of three general resolution categories: <1m, 1–10m, or >10m.</p>
          <p>Some degree of approximation and deviation is therefore unavoidable with this approach. But this interpretive margin is not a flaw it is part of the critical inquiry: How much do we really know when we are shown a satellite image? And what remains absent and unseen?</p>

      <div class="info-column">
          <p>Geospatial Narratives is part of an ongoing project dedicated to the archiving, contextualization, and critical engagement with the use of satellite data in journalistic and narrative contexts. The goal is to make these applications visible, searchable, filterable, and comparable. 
          <p>Curation follows an editorial practice: iterative, subjective, and open to new perspectives.</p>
          <p>This applies not only to the satellite imagery itself but also to the accompanying theoretical materials particularly the article list and the glossary. Both sections are conceived as curated companions and conceptual tools that aim to foster a reflective engagement with the narrative and analytical use of satellite data. They make no claim to completeness or academic authority, but instead invite an open, interdisciplinary dialogue.</p>
          <p><mark>The archive</mark> collects examples in which satellite images are used in journalistic, investigative, activist or artistic contexts. It traces how such images circulate and attempts to highlight their narrative, political and media dimensions - and at the same time to fill gaps in public documentation.
The archive does not offer a comprehensive overview, but represents a curated selection characterised by narrative relevance, linguistic accessibility and a focus on predominantly Western, English-language sources. I recognise the limitations of this perspective and welcome suggestions for expansion.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-column">
          <p><mark>The article list</mark> brings together a deliberately diverse range of perspectives: from (popular) scientific publications and media-theoretical or philosophical texts to journalistic reports and NGO-based analyses. It includes books, online articles, essays, interviews, and videos that exemplify how satellite imagery is used within cultural, political, and media discourse.
The selection is guided by criteria such as narrative and analytical relevance, linguistic accessibility, and interdisciplinary significance.</p>
          <p><mark>The glossary</mark> expands this collection with a hybrid vocabulary - a mix of technical terms, scientific concepts, and critical or poetic figures of thought drawn from fields such as remote sensing, media theory, design research, and philosophy. Some entries offer foundational knowledge about how satellite technologies function. Others act as prompts: metaphors, theoretical frameworks, or conceptual tools for questioning how we perceive, interpret, and use such technologies. Where terms stem from established disciplines (e.g., spatial resolution, multispectral imaging), definitions follow common standards - but are deliberately contextualized and made accessible. Where terms are more speculative or media-theoretical (e.g., remote gaze, machine vision, visual regime), they draw on a broader, often non-unified body of references - not shaped by consensus, but by critical depth and openness to interpretation.</p>
          <p>All entries (see Methodology) have been included without prior authorisation from the original authors or publications. Deletions may be requested at any time.</p>

        <p>This platform serves as an open, collective, ever-evolving resource for the critical study of satellite data as media in narrative and investigative contexts. It invites contributions that expand the scope of the archive and promote a better public understanding of how satellite data is used, interpreted and circulated.</p>
        <p>Submissions may fall into two categories:</p>
        <p><mark>Narrative Use:</mark> examples in which satellite imagery plays a central role in narratives, analyses or reports. These can be news articles, visual studies or artistic works that use satellite data for more than just illustration.</p>
        <p><mark>Satellite Literacy:</mark> contributions that promote a critical examination of the medium itself. This includes basic explanations as well as more interpretative or speculative considerations. Contributions may cover key concepts from the fields of remote sensing, media theory, design research, critical geography or philosophy.</p></p>

      <div class="info-column">
        <p>Contributions from different application contexts, regions and cultures are welcome. This archive is based on the conviction that satellite images are never neutral. Their narrative potential, biases and blind spots only become apparent through different perspectives. Accordingly, I also recognize the limitations of my own perspective, which is primarily shaped by Western, English- and German-language media.</p>
        <p>Submissions are reviewed based on their relevance, contextual clarity, and alignment with the platform’s editorial focus. Items used decoratively or without critical framing may fall outside the scope of the archive.</p>
